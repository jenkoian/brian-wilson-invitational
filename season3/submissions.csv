I went to see The Subways with Tom Muise and Dave Fellows and his girlfriend. We were 14. I bought a tshirt. Muisey managed to get us some horrible pints of Carling. David Fellows kept necking his lass. An older man, a kind of Ian Brown x Ricky Tomlinson hybrid in a white adidas tracksuit and aviator sunglasses, offered us a gary each in the toilets. We refused. 

Afterwards, we went to Paddy's Bar on London Road and got served. Went there almost every Friday night until we turned 18. The old Irish ladies behind the bar, Anne and Frances (both easily in their 70s) were like grandmothers to us and I'll never forget them. 

The Subways? Forgot all about them until this week.
